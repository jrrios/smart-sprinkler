# smart-sprinkler
This project forms the basis for a smart sprinkler system where we use sensors and an arduino to allow people to efficiently water their lawn and gardens in an environmentally friendly manner.

This system monitors key metrics and information sources to keep their grass growing and thriving, such as
- Moisture Level
- Sunlight
- Current Weather
- Recent Rain
- Probablility of Rain
- Checks the Austin Water Regulatory system 

#City Friendly Water System 
We scrape the data from the Austin Water regulation to check if there are water usage restrictions in Austin or not to see if it is a good time to water your grass.

#Required Libraries Python 2.7
Most of the project is done in python, Arduino, and Django code. To install the python libraries use pip install for the following:
- pip install googlemaps
- pip install requests 
- pip install datetime
